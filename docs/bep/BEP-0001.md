# BEP-0001: BESSAI Enhancement Proposal Process

**BEP Number:** 0001  
**Title:** BESSAI Enhancement Proposal (BEP) Process  
**Author:** BESSAI Engineering Team <ingenieria@bess-solutions.cl>  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Type:** Governance  
**Created:** 2026-02-22  
**Accepted:** 2026-02-22  
**Supersedes:** N/A

## Abstract

This BEP defines the **BESSAI Enhancement Proposal (BEP)** process — the formal mechanism for proposing, discussing, and ratifying significant changes to BESSAI specifications, governance, and architecture. BEP-0001 is the meta-BEP: it defines the process by which all future BEPs are handled.

---

## Motivation

As BESSAI Edge Gateway matures and attracts external adopters, a transparent, structured process for changes is essential:

1. External contributors need a predictable path to propose changes.
2. Adopters need stability guarantees — breaking changes must be announced with adequate notice.
3. Regulators and standards bodies evaluate governance quality before recognizing a project as a reference implementation.
4. Without a formal process, decisions can be contested or reversed without community visibility.

## BEP Types

| Type | Description | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Standards Track** | Changes to any BESSAI-SPEC-* document | New tag in SPEC-001, new payload type in SPEC-003 |
| **Governance** | Changes to GOVERNANCE.md, this BEP process, or TSC membership rules | Adding a new TSC seat, changing quorum rules |
| **Informational** | Architecturally significant observations that do not change specs | Best practices for deploying in isolated OT networks |

---

## BEP Numbering

| Range | Reserved For |
|---|---|
| 0001 – 0099 | Governance and process BEPs |
| 0100 – 0999 | Standards Track BEPs (SPEC changes) |
| 1000+ | Informational BEPs |

### State Definitions

| State | Description |
|---|---|
| **Draft** | BEP is being written. Not yet open for formal comment. |
| **Under Review** | BEP PR is open. 14-day comment period is running. Discussion thread is active. |
| **Accepted** | Quorum achieved. Changes are merged. |
| **Rejected** | TSC voted against acceptance. Rationale documented in BEP. |
| **Withdrawn** | Author withdrew the proposal. |
| **Superseded** | A newer BEP replaces this one. `Supersedes` field updated. |

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Idea Discussion (OPTIONAL but RECOMMENDED)
Open a GitHub Discussion using the **"BEP Pre-Discussion"** template before writing a BEP. This is an opportunity to get early feedback and determine if a BEP is the right vehicle or if a simpler PR suffices.

> A BEP is NOT required for: bug fixes, documentation improvements, new device drivers, test additions, or non-breaking new features. BEPs are for changes that affect external interfaces or governance.

### Step 2: Write the BEP

Fork the repository and create `docs/bep/BEP-XXXX.md` using the template in Section "BEP Template" below.

- Assign the next available BEP number in the appropriate range.
- Set status to `Draft`.

### Step 3: Open the PR and Discussion

1. Open a Pull Request with your BEP file.
2. Open a GitHub Discussion using the **"BEP Discussion"** template, linking to the PR.
3. Set BEP status to `Under Review`.
4. The 14-day comment period begins when the Discussion is opened.

### Step 4: Review Period

- All community members MAY comment in the GitHub Discussion.
- TSC members MUST review the BEP within the comment period.
- The BEP author MUST respond to all substantive objections raised by TSC members.
- The author MAY revise the BEP in response to feedback (revision resets the 14-day period only if changes are substantive).

### Step 5: TSC Vote

After the comment period:
- Any TSC member may call for a vote via a comment on the PR.
- **Quorum**: Minimum 2 TSC members must vote.
- **Majority**: Simple majority of votes cast.
- **External requirement**: At least 1 TSC member external to BESS Solutions must be among the approving votes (for Standards Track and Governance BEPs).
- Vote is conducted as GitHub PR reviews (Approve / Request Changes).

### Step 6: Merge or Close

- **Accepted**: PR is merged. BEP status updated to `Accepted`. CHANGELOG.md updated.
- **Rejected**: PR is closed. BEP status updated to `Rejected`. Rejection rationale is documented in the BEP file and committed.
- **Withdrawn**: PR is closed by author. BEP status updated to `Withdrawn`.

## Abstract

[2-5 sentence summary of what this BEP proposes and why.]

## Motivation

[Why is this change needed? What problem does it solve?]

## Specification

[The normative content of the proposal. For Standards Track BEPs, describe
the changes to the relevant BESSAI-SPEC-* document(s). Use MUST/SHALL/SHOULD
per RFC 2119.]

## Backward Compatibility

[Does this break existing implementations? If yes, what is the migration path
and what is the notice period?]

## Reference Implementation

[Link to a PR, branch, or prototype that demonstrates the proposal.]

## Rejected Alternatives

[What else was considered and why was it not chosen?]

## Open Questions

[Any unresolved questions that reviewers should address.]
```

## Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

The TSC is responsible for approving BEPs and governing the specification process. See `GOVERNANCE.md` for the full TSC charter, membership rules, and election process.

**Current TSC composition** is documented in `GOVERNANCE.md` under the "Technical Steering Committee" section.
