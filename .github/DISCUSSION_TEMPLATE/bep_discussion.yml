        ## Before you open this discussion
        A BEP (BESSAI Enhancement Proposal) is required only for changes that affect:
        - BESSAI-SPEC-* specifications (driver interface, safety requirements, telemetry schema)
        - GOVERNANCE.md or the BEP process itself
        - Architectural changes that break compatibility for external adopters

        **For bug fixes, new device drivers, or non-breaking features, open a PR directly.**
